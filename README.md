# Different addition in linked-list
## In this ques we have to take the element of both linked list as a single number, add them and disp it in another linked list in seperate digit, taking cake of carry(if any).
### for ex:-
### list1 is 4->3->2->1
### list2 is 8->7->6->5
### ele of list 1 and 2 = 4321 , 8765
### Addition => 4321 + 8765 = 13086
### therefore the output is 1->3->0->8->6
